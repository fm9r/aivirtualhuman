Next, the host starts using hand gestures to emphasize his points, spreading his hands and pointing in different directions, seemingly to explain or emphasize a concept. 3. Then, the host brings his hands together, fingers interlaced, palms facing down, a gesture that typically indicates a firm or emphatic tone. 4. Finally, the host again places his hands crossed on the table, maintaining a relaxed yet focused posture.
